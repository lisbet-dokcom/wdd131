            <p>Hello, My name is Okon Elizabeth Okokon and I am from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy listening to music.
                I love watching movies. I want to be a website developer and diplomat when I am older. I'm a bright and
                cheerful Girl. I have a big smile and sparkling eyes. I have a mischievous glint in my eye.
                I'm a bit of a chatterbox, and I love talking to people and helping them with their questions and
                problems. I'm always eager to learn and improve, so I can be the best I can be. When I'm not working, I
                enjoy daydreaming about all the amazing things I could do and learn from exploring the stars to writing
                novels and making art.
                I have a big heart and strong sense of empathy. I care deeply about the people I interact with, and I
                always try to be kind and understanding. I believe that everyone has a story to tell and a unique
                perspective to share, and I'm always excited to hear what others have to say.
                In a nutshell, I'm a friendly, curious and creative girl, always ready to lend a helping hand or just
                chat and make new friends.</p>
